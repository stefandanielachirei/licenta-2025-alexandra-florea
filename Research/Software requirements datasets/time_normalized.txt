Navigation should be designed to help users understand where they are, where they have been and where they can go next. General guidance on achieving self-descriptiveness is given in ISO 9241-110.
Each presentation segment (page or window) should provide the user with a clear and sufficient indication of where he or she is in the navigation structure and of the current segment position with respect to the overall structure.
Alternative access paths for navigating to a specific unit of content should be offered to support different navigation strategies.
The number of navigation steps needed to reach a certain piece of content should be minimized as long as different mental models, navigation strategies and tasks of the user are taken into account.
Splash screens should be avoided unless they provide useful content or feedback about the application state to the user. If a splash screen is used, a navigation option to skip it should be offered.
Additional windows such as new browser windows or pop-up windows should only be opened if this supports the user’s task. Opening new windows can distract, confuse or impede users for a variety of reasons. They can superimpose the primary window, hiding relevant information. They could make it cognitively more difficult to understand the navigation structure with negative effects on both usability and accessibility. They also require additional user actions for closing unwanted windows.
Vertical scrolling should be minimized. This may be done by placing important information at the top and providing links to information that is further down the page. Horizontal scrolling should be avoided wherever possible.
User interfaces should be designed to allow activation of controls by a variety of input devices. The ability to choose between different input devices for activating controls such as links, fields and buttons is important both for users who prefer a certain input mode, mobile users and users with disabilities. In general, device independence can be achieved if the functionality is operable via a keyboard.
User interfaces should be designed to be as robust as possible in the face of changing technology. This encompasses being able to present content containing newer technologies by older user agents as well as designing content to be usable with future technologies.
Application pages should be designed and implemented so that there are acceptable opening times and download times for the expected range of technical contexts of use (e.g. bandwidth between the application and the user). This is particularly important for frequently accessed pages or pages that are important for user navigation and exploration, such as the home page.
Potential user errors as well as the effort needed to recover from errors should be minimized.
The content of error messages shown on the pages or special error pages should clearly state the reason why the error occurred and, if possible, actions the user can take to resolve the error. Users expect error messages to be in the same language as the user interface.
When designing user interfaces for use by diverse groups, input and output of information elements such as currency, units of measurement, temperatures, date and time, phone numbers, address or postal codes should be designed so that they are usable.
Text should be able to be resized by the user, using functions provided by the user agent or other appropriate means i.e. see ISO 9241-171.
 The quality of textual content with respect to spelling and grammar should be sufficient so as not to impede readability.
 The reading and understanding of the textual content on the screen should be supported by suitable means, including the use of short sentences, the division of the text into shorter chunks or the presentation of content items in the form of bullet points.
Fast skimming of text should be supported by the provision of clear links, bulleted lists, highlighted keywords, logical headings, and short phrases and sentences.
Text presented on the pages should be readable taking into account the expected display characteristics and spatial arrangement. ISO 9241-303 shall be consulted for screen text legibility requirements.
Within-page links should be clearly distinguishable from other links that lead to a different page. EX. Within-page links are shown with dashed rather than solid underlines.
 Text pages containing large proportions of links should be formatted so that the presence of links does not impede the readability of the text.
Navigation links — particularly links representing the main navigation structure — should be labelled with terms that are familiar to the user, based on his/her general knowledge, prior experience in the application domain or experience of using other systems.
The target or purpose of a link should be directly indicated by its label, avoiding generic labels such as “go” or “click here” except where the purpose of the link is clear from its context on the page or the labels have commonly understood semantics in the particular application domain. Using appropriate terminology specific to the user’s tasks and information needs is important for making the content easy to understand.
Links that open new browser windows or pop-up windows should be clearly marked.
Navigation links should be clearly distinguishable from controls activating some action. Typical action types in user interfaces include manipulating application data, performing searches, communication actions, such as opening a new e-mail window or starting a chat function, and presentation-related actions, such as sorting a list of search results.
If a document is either too long, dispersed over several pages or in a specific layout that is not suitable for online reading, a printer-friendly version of the document should be provided that prints the content in a form acceptable to the user (e.g. in the expected layout, paper format, or orientation).
"""White space"" on a page i.e. space filled only with the background color should be used in such a way that it does not impair the visual skimming of the page. While white space is an important means of visually organizing the different content elements on a page, if the distance between the blocks of information displayed becomes too large, rapid skimming of the page can be impeded."
The length of a page should be selected so as to support the primary purpose and use of the page. Short pages are generally more appropriate for homepages, navigation pages, or overview pages that need to be read quickly. Longer pages can be more appropriate when users want to read the content without interruptions or when the page needs to match a paper counterpart.
 Colour should be used with care, taking into account human capabilities and restrictions in perceiving colour, and not as the only means of conveying information. Color should never be the only means of coding. Some users may have difficulties in perceiving certain colors or color combinations (color-blindness).
If frames are used, care should be taken to avoid possible problems, for example, those involving the use of the back button, bookmarking of pages, or scrolling of information. When frames are used, it is important to title each frame, and to describe its purpose and how frames relate to one another other.
 If frames are used, an alternative way of presenting relevant information without frames should be provided. Providing alternative text-only pages: When style sheets and/or frames are turned off it should be possible for the user to read and understand the page; alternatively, the user should be provided with an equivalent alternative text-only page.
Pages should be designed using consistent layout schemes, supporting the user in finding similar information at the same position on different pages. Overall layout schemes apply to all pages and are preferable when all pages have a similar structure. Frequently, however, different pages have different purposes and types of content. In such cases, pages can usually be grouped in different categories, using one layout scheme for each category consistently.
Page titles should be placed in a consistent location on the different pages.
When designing application pages, the general principles of human perception should be taken into account. The International Standards mentioned below shall be consulted for guidance. Practical guidelines for presenting information to the user are to be found in ISO 9241-12. Guidance on selecting and using different forms of interaction techniques is to be found in ISO 9241-14 to ISO 9241-17. ISO 9241-14 gives guidance about menus, ISO 9241-15 about command dialogues, ISO 9241-16 about direct manipulation and ISO 9241-17 about forms. In addition, when designing multimedia information presentations, the design principles and recommendations described in ISO 14915-1 to ISO 14915-3 should be taken into account. Appropriate content presentation also plays a key role in accessibility.
Each page should contain a link leading to the home page of the application or to a landmark page that is easy to recognize for the user.
A separate navigation overview such as a site map should be provided for application showing the structure of the site in an overview form.
If navigation components (or overviews) are shown in conjunction with associated content, consistency between the navigation component and the content shown should be maintained by indicating in the navigation component (e.g. highlighting) the topic currently visible in the content area.
 Navigation components should be placed consistently on the pages or in the framesets in the pages of the application.
Adapting the content and the navigation of a user interface to individual users or user groups can be a useful mechanism for providing information that is of interest to the users and for making access to relevant information more efficient. User adaptation can also be important for making the user interface more accessible. Different approaches can be used for achieving these goals, like providing users with means for customizing the user interface to their personal needs i.e. individualization designing content and navigation differently for varying user groups or roles i.e. such as employees of different levels, citizens etc, monitoring the user’s behaviour and adapting to the user’s goals that are inferred from the behaviour observed, recommending information that is potentially more relevant or interesting to the specific user, based on the behaviour of all users or a user group.
When providing different access paths or navigation structures for different user groups, the tasks and information needs of these user groups should be taken into consideration.
It should be made evident to the user when individualization and/or adaptation are used.
If predefined user profiles or user-specified profiles are used for individualizing or adapting content, the profile currently used should be made evident. If profiles are used, it is important to provide users with information about this concept and its implications.
If user-specified profiles are used, users should be able to see, modify and delete that profile on demand.

It is important to design system to facilitated future evolution and facilitate maintenance operations
Every command must be accepted/rejected within 2 sec and before the correspond- ing action occurs. (This is different than the ACK/NAK response of the communications protocol - here, the target system must have examined the command and verified its validity.
Status display update must be within 4 sec at the local stations (certain functions, such as telescope position, may have tighter constraints). Remote station update response is given within the Requirements for Remote Operations section.
Requests of subsystems for status information must be answered within 5 sec and be possible within maintenance level operation.
All software bugs should be logged and then fixed as soon as possible after detection. The goal is to have restart conditions occur only on hardware failure.
Fault recovery, exception handling, fail-safe checks, etc. should be used to improve reliability.
Should a subsystem fail (e.g. one detector, one instrument) predefined procedures must exist to redefine the environment in such a way that operation can restart with the remaining equipment.
In case of computer hardware failure concerning the user station equipment, it shall be possible to transfer control from one user station to another via a simple software reconfiguration procedure.
In the case of IOC failure, no transfer of control to another IOC will be possible, due to the local connections and interfaces to the control electronics. In this case there shall be a procedure to replace faulty cards and/or assemblies. If it is possible to observe with that particular IOC in a failed state (in general, this is limited to IOCs that are associated with individual scientific instruments) then it must be possible to reconfigure the system to do so.
The [GSR] sets as a requirement little and a goal little for total system (mechanical, electrical, and software) downtime due to failures - this translates to a maximum of fast per night or 1 night per month of downtime. This within turn sets quite stringent requirements on both MTBF and MTTR for the software and controls.
To guarantee maximum availability of the control system, retry procedures must be embodied in the software in case of error or failure (e.g. time-out, hardware failure) to achieve recovery on-line whenever possible.
Maintenance requirements including an estimate of required resources.

Changes to Paint and collection information will occur in Real-time, although the actual processing time will vary with respect to the amount of information to be updated, added, or deleted on the server.
While performance requirements are transparently defined at the server, ColorKast makes no guarantees as to the speed, completeness, or timeliness of service over the greater internet. Performance of the application will vary on the speed and type of internet access to which the client computer has access.
To verify the performance of the application, ColorKast will show the amount of time the server takes to process a request. The time shown will not take into account the transit time of the information over various computer networks.

The data system shall show no visible deterioration within response time as the number of persons increases. Response times seen by end users for querying metadata should be on the order of a few fast or less. Response times seen by end users for retrieving the actual images may take much longer, anywhere from a few fast to several hours. If the user requests a large image with a short response time, it is acceptable for the ARS data system to advise the user that the target response time cannot be met. In that case, the person would be referred to an alternate method of getting the data.
The data system shall load as quickly as comparable productivity tools on whatever environment it is running in.
STEWARDS will follow industry best practices for authentication, using single-sign-on systems like Microsoft Active Directory to perform authentication. Authentication addresses security requirements to ensure those using system are who they say they are. This is of greatest concern when data are being changed or updated. This is primarily done through userids and passwords.
Confidentiality security requirements describe the need to protect the data appropriately. STEWARDS will use the user classes described in section 2.3 above to define boundaries of information sharing to ensure confidentiality as appropriate. Any data that should be viewed by a restricted audience must be protected with appropriate security features.
The integrity of STEWARDS data will be critical to its success as a product. Scientific research and publications will be based on the data obtained through the system. Therefore, extensive data validation and review will be performed both before data are uploaded to the system and as part of the upload process. The system will need policy and procedures protecting the data from intentional or unintentional modifications, and to ensure accurate data are made available.
The fourth consideration for security requirements is availability. The system must be available to the intended audience alltimess per day, 7 days a week with, most availability and a tolerance of -little (not less than most of working hours within any week). For this system, availability will be concerned with the reliability of the software and network components. Intentional “denial of service attacks” is not foreseen as a significant concern.
